It replaces the traditional muffle-furnace workflow — less operator time, better repeatability and closed-loop reporting for fuel and mineral laboratories.",
      "The TGA 3000 handles up to 34 samples in a single sequence with automatic evaluation, while the benchtop TGA 1500 suits lower-throughput labs. Both are widely used for coal, coke, biomass, petroleum coke and soil analysis under ASTM D7582 and ISO 17245.
